description: Discard queued learnings without processing
allowed-tools: Bash
---

## Context
- Queue count: !`python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/read_queue.py" 2>/dev/null | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(len(json.load(sys.stdin)))" 2>/dev/null || echo 0`

## Your Task

1. If queue is empty:
   - Output: "Queue is already empty. Nothing to skip."
   - Exit

2. If queue has items:
   - Show: "You are about to discard [count] learning(s). These will be lost:"
   - List each queued item briefly (type + first 50 chars of message)
   - Ask: "Are you sure? [y/n]"

3. If user confirms (y/yes):
   - Clear the project queue:
   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/clear_queue.py"
   ```
   - Output: "Discarded [count] learnings. Queue cleared."

4. If user declines (n/no):
   - Output: "Aborted. Run /reflect to process learnings instead."

## Note
This is an escape hatch for when auto-detection captures false positives
or learnings aren't worth saving. Use sparingly.
